Process:
1. Learnt as much as I could about React and its syntax because I have not use it before.
2. Grabbed data from Marvel API using its Interactive Documentation to test application.
3. Focused on the backend first. Made sure I could extract the needed data and display it using React.
4. Created the React components. Worked on the dropdown list, made sure selecting a character changed what was displayed.
5. Made the front-end look appealing.
6. Worked on the positions. Making sure the two additional positions can be chosen by user.
7. Fixed up and finalised the front-end.
8. Made it so the two additional players' position can be changed.
9. Planning to move onto dynamic data.
10. Planning to make the team shareable to social media.
